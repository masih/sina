/**
 * A Random Number Generator (RNG) where the generated numbers are derived from a given {@link ProbabilityDistribution}.
 * This RNG uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse Transform Sampling</a> to generate random numbers:
 * <blockquote>
 * The problem that the inverse transform sampling method solves is as follows:<br/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Let {@code X} be a random variable whose distribution can be described by the cumulative distribution function {@code F}
 * <li>We want to generate values of {@code X} which are distributed according to this distribution.</li>
 * </ul> The inverse transform sampling method works as follows: <br/>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Generate a random number {@code u} from the standard uniform distribution in the interval {@code [0, 1]}
 * <li>Compute the value {@code x} such that {@code F(x) = u}
 * <li>Take {@code x} to be the random number drawn from the distribution described by {@code F}
 * </ol>
